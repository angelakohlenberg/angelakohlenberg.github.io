			I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Operations Management at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, where 
              		I am advised by Professor
                 	<a class="in-text" href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/gurvich_itai.aspx" target="_blank">Itai Gurvich</a>.

		My research focuses on the operations of two-sided markets, where both demand and supply arrive and depart dynamically over time.  
		Examples include organ exchange programs, ride-hailing platforms, and perishable inventory systems such as blood and food banks. 
		My work to date examines how impatience impacts the performance and optimal control of dynamic matching markets, 
		primarily using queueing theory. 
		<br> <br> 

		I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Operations Management from the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada) 
              	and an MBA from the Schulich School of Business, York University (Toronto, Canada). 
                Before joining the PhD program at Kellogg, I taught undergraduate and MBA courses in operations management and business analytics 
              	at the University of Alberta and Macewan University (Edmonton, Canada). 
                Previously, I held analyst and management positions in the public sector, where I used data analytics 
		and OM tools (e.g. forecasting, simulation, process flow analysis) to improve service delivery and 
              	decision-making related to urban planning.

    		We study matching queues with abandonment. The simplest of these is the two-sided queue with servers on one side and customers on the other, both arriving dynamically over time and abandoning if not matched by the time their patience elapses. We identify non-asymptotic and universal scaling laws for the matching loss due to abandonment, which we refer to as the "cost-of-impatience." The scaling laws characterize the way in which this cost depends on the arrival rates and the (possibly different) mean patience of servers and customers.<br>
		<br>Our characterization reveals four operating regimes identified by an operational measure of patience that brings together mean patience and utilization. The four regimes subsume the regimes that arise in asymptotic (heavy-traffic) approximations. The scaling laws, specialized to each regime, reveal the fundamental structure of the cost-of-impatience and show that its order-of-magnitude is fully determined by (i) a "winner-take-all" competition between customer impatience and utilization, and (ii) the ability to accumulate inventory on the server side. Practically important is that when servers are impatient, the cost-of-impatience is, up to an order-of-magnitude, given by an insightful expression where only the minimum of the two patience rates appears.<br>
		<br>Considering the trade-off between abandonment and capacity costs, we characterize the scaling of the optimal safety capacity as a function of costs, arrival rates, and patience parameters. We prove that the ability to hold inventory of servers means that the optimal safety capacity grows logarithmically in abandonment cost and, in turn, slower than the square-root growth in the single-sided queue.

    		We study dynamic matching in two-sided markets with heterogeneous and impatient demand and supply, and demand-dependent match rewards.
			 These markets face a trade-off between delaying matches to allow for better options and performing matches quickly to prevent agent abandonment. 
			A policy that greedily matches agents over the entire market ignores the potential benefits of reserving inventory (waiting agents) for better future matches.
			However, greedily matching supply over a subset of the highest-reward demand may sacrifice the opportunity to match supply before it abandons. 
			<br> <br> Our results reveal that the optimality of greedy matching policies depends on the fundamental questions: Can, and should, excess inventory be held on the supply-side of the market?
			We derive precise expressions of the market parameters, which are translated into intuitive market characteristics, to answer these questions. 
			A policy is scale optimal if its reward loss due to abandonment is on the same order as the optimal policy. 
			We develop an algorithm for general two-sided networks that identifies whether a greedy policy is scale optimal, and, if so, specifies the optimal market design such that greedily matching agents over specified partitions of the network is scale optimal.
