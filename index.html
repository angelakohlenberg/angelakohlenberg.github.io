    		We study matching queues with abandonment. The simplest of these is the two-sided queue with servers on one side and customers on the other, both arriving dynamically over time and abandoning if not matched by the time their patience elapses. We identify non-asymptotic and universal scaling laws for the matching loss due to abandonment, which we refer to as the "cost-of-impatience." The scaling laws characterize the way in which this cost depends on the arrival rates and the (possibly different) mean patience of servers and customers.<br>
		<br>Our characterization reveals four operating regimes identified by an operational measure of patience that brings together mean patience and utilization. The four regimes subsume the regimes that arise in asymptotic (heavy-traffic) approximations. The scaling laws, specialized to each regime, reveal the fundamental structure of the cost-of-impatience and show that its order-of-magnitude is fully determined by (i) a "winner-take-all" competition between customer impatience and utilization, and (ii) the ability to accumulate inventory on the server side. Practically important is that when servers are impatient, the cost-of-impatience is, up to an order-of-magnitude, given by an insightful expression where only the minimum of the two patience rates appears.<br>
		<br>Considering the trade-off between abandonment and capacity costs, we characterize the scaling of the optimal safety capacity as a function of costs, arrival rates, and patience parameters. We prove that the ability to hold inventory of servers means that the optimal safety capacity grows logarithmically in abandonment cost and, in turn, slower than the square-root growth in the single-sided queue.

    		We study the trade-off between match quality and quantity in dynamic matching with impatient agents. In these matching markets, delaying matches may allow for better options to become available as more agents arrive, but can also lead to lost matches as agents depart. Matching decisions must balance the competing objectives of higher-quality matches and a greater number of matches. 
		<br><br>We consider a two-sided matching market with impatient, heterogeneous agents and matches that are either high-quality (high reward) or low-quality (low reward). We show that the optimal balance between match quality and quantity is determined by the amount of waiting agents (Inventory Imbalance) and the “cost” of waiting (Reward-Loss Ratio) on each side of the market. A matching market operates in one of four regimes based on informative expressions of the Inventory Imbalance and/or Reward-Loss Ratio.
		<br><br>When excess inventory cannot accumulate on the short side of the market, the market is in either the Quantity-Driven, Quality-Driven, or Flexible regime, based only on the mean patience of each side: either a greedy policy (Quantity-Driven and Flexible) or dedicated policy that only performs high-quality matches (Quality-Driven) is near-optimal. When the Inventory Imbalance is large relative to the Reward-Loss Ratio, the market is the Quantity-Driven regime and a greedy policy is near-optimal. When the Inventory Imbalance is very small relative to the Reward-Loss Ratio, the market is in the Quality-Driven regime and a dedicated policy is near-optimal. Otherwise, the market is the Balanced regime and low-quality matches should only be performed when there is enough inventory on the short side.

                    I hold a bachelor’s degree in Operations Management from the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada) 
              and an MBA from the Schulich School of Business, York University (Toronto, Canada). 
                    Prior to joining 
              the PhD program at Kellogg, I was teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in Operations Management 
              at the University of Alberta and Macewan University (Edmonton, Canada). 
                    Previously, I held analyst and 
              management positions in the public sector, where I was primarily responsible for using data analytics 
              and OM tools (i.e. forecasting, simulation, process flow analysis) to improve service delivery and 
              decision-making related to urban planning and land development. <br> <br> <br> <br>
